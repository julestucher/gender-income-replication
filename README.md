# Replication: Relative income within the household, gender norms, and well-being

The article for this replication, “Relative income within the household, gender norms, and well-being,” is 
a 2024 study that uses regression discontinuity design (RDD) on longitudinal observation data to examine
the effects of women out-earning their husbands on overall life satisfaction and health outcomes (Gihleb, et
al. 2024). It explores the differences in effect between East and West Germany, where social norms about women’s
participation in the workforce differs. In this project, I replicated the main figures from the original paper,
as well as performing the two RD analyses. See `replication_paper.pdf` for complete project.
